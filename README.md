A simple React.js Metronome, done as an exercise by me. You can seat beats per minute and beats per measure which alternates 2 sounds.

What still needs improvement: first measure may not start from its beginning but then it's ok.

This is a React app, run "npm install" after you cloned it, and than "npm start" to view it.
